## Plasma Kinetic Theory and the Vlasov Equation

This theoretical project was carried out for the course `097600 – Methods and Models for Statistical Mechanics` at *Politecnico di Milano*.  
The work provides an analytical study of the **Vlasov equation** for collisionless plasmas, following and expanding upon the main reference paper [1]. Its aim is to clearly present the theoretical framework, derivations, and physical interpretation underlying the kinetic description of plasmas.
